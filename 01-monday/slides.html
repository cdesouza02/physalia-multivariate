# Multivariate data

# Multivariate data

Multivariate != multiple regression

Multivariate means we have two or more *response* variables

We are interested in learning about the common patterns or modes of variation among those multiple response variables

Multivariate data require special statistical methods

---

# Multivariate data in biology

Community composition &amp;mdash; many species as the responses

In modern biology we have OTUs and ASVs

In chemistry we have metabolites or spectra or masses or &amp;hellip;

All of these constitute multivariate data

---

# Species composition

Species composition is the set of species in a site or a sample

Typically comes with a measure of abundance

"abundance" could also be whether each species is present or absent in the sample

Relative abundance expresses the abundance of each species as its proportion out of the total abundance in each sample

Cattell (1952) notes that the ecological data matrix can be studied from two main view points

1. the relationships among the samples (objects)
2. the relationships among the variables (species, descriptors)

but other viewpoints are possible

---

# Q and R mode

Measuring dependence between variables (descriptors; species, environment) typically done using coefficients like Pearson's `\(r\)`

Hence this mode of analysis is *R* mode

*Q* mode relates to methods that focus on dependencies among objects (samples)

Often difficult to identify the mode; PCA starts from a dispersion matrix of variables (R mode) but provides an ordination of the samples (Q mode)

* `\(s_{ijk}\)` is similarity between sites `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` for the `\(k\)`th variable.

# Double zero problem

&lt;img src="./resources/response-curve.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Double zero problem

If a species is present at sites `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` we take this as a reflection of the two sites' similarity

If a species is *absent* from one of `\(i\)` or `\(j\)` we take this as a reflection of some ecological difference between the two sites

But, what if the species is absent from *both* `\(i\)` and `\(j\)`?

--

The species could be absent for different reasons

* too hot in `\(i\)` and too cold in `\(j\)`
* too dry in `\(i\)` and to wet in `\(j\)`
---

# Double zero problem

We may choose not to attach ecological meaning to a joint or *double* absence when computing association

Coefficients that skip double zeroes are *asymmetric*

Coefficients that do not skip double zeroes are *symmetric*

---

# Metrics

Three types of quantitative distance coefficient

1. Metric

2. Semi-metric

3. Non-metric

Groups pertain to how the coefficient obeys certain metric rules

Some use the term "distance coefficient" to only refer to those that are metric, using "dissimilarity" for other semi- and non-metrics

---

# Metric coefficients

Obey four rules

1. minimum = 0: if `\(i = j\)` then `\(d_{ij} = 0\)`

2. positivity: if `\(i \neq j\)` then `\(d_{ij} \gt 0\)`

3. symmetry: `\(d_{ij} = d_{ji}\)`

4. triangle inequality: `\(d_{ij} + d_{jk} \ge d_{ik}\)`

Last rule states that the *sum* of 2 sides of a triangle in Euclidean space are necessarily `\(\ge\)` the 3rd side

---

# Others types

Semi-metrics do not obey the triangle inequality rule

Non-metrics do not obey the positivity rule

# Transformations

* Can transform the variables (e.g. species) or the samples to improve the gradient separation of the dissimilarity coefficient.
* No transformation of variables or samples leads to a situation of quantity domination &amp;mdash; big values dominate `\(d_{ij}\)`.
* Normalise samples &amp;mdash; gives all samples equal weight.
* Normalise variables;
    * gives all variables equal weight,
    * inflates the influence of rare species.
* Double (_Wisconsin_) transformation; standardize variables then samples.
* Noy-Meir _et al_. (1975) _J. Ecology_ **63**; 779--800
* Faith _et al_. (1987) _Vegetatio_ **69**; 57--68

Sample normalization - In this transformation we divide the values of each row (i.e. the values of each vegetation observation) by the length of the row vector (i.e. its norm) (see Legendre &amp; Gallagher 2001). This transformation is related to the Chord and Hellinger distances. Like the sample total standardization, the sample normalization also fixes the maximum possible distance between samples.

Species maximum standardization - In this transformation, we divide the values of each column (i.e. the values of each species) by its maximum. The species maximum standardization has the effect of making the maximum value of all species equal to one. Since the minimum value of most species is zero, this transformation has the effect of making the scale of abundance relative for each species. In general, the species maximum standardization reduces the weight of dominant species and increases the weight of less abundant species (van der Maarel, 1979). This transformation makes the abundance values for taxa in a sample dependent on the other samples in the data set.

Sample total standardization - In this transformation we divide the values of each row (i.e. the values of each vegetation observation) by its maximum. The sample total standardization has the effect of eliminating differences in total abundance from the data set. One possible benefit is that it eliminates possible observer bias in estimating abundance. Since the sample total standardization fixes the total abundance in samples, it also fixes the maximum possible geometric distance between samples.

Wisconsin double standardization - In this transformation, the abundance values are first standardized by species maximum standardization, and then by sample total standardization, and by convention multiplied by 100. Bray and Curtis (1957) employed a double standardization before ordination. In their study, tree species were measured on different scales than were shrubs and herbs (density and basal area for trees, frequency for herbs and shrubs), so that a species maximum standardization achieved a common scale. Their rationalization for the subsequent sample total standardization was that not all samples had the same number of measurements, and that the stand total standardizations achieved a more uniform basis for comparison.

# Cluster analysis

---

# Basic aim of cluster analysis

* Partition a set of data (objects, samples) into groups known as clusters.
* Partitions formed that minimise a stated mathematical criterion, e.g. sum of squares (SS)
    * Minimise within groups SS &amp;rarr; maximising between group SS
* Cluster analysis is a compromise however:
    * With 50 objects there are `\(10^{80}\)` possible ways of partitioning the objects
* Compromise is made in selecting a clustering scheme that reduces the number of partitions to a reasonable value.
* Commonest approaches impose a hierarchy and then either fuse (_agglomerative_) or split (_divisive_) samples and clusters.

---

# A taxonomy of clusterings

* Clustering techniques can be characterised in many ways:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Formal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Informal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hierarchical&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Non-hierarchical&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quantitative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Qualitative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Agglomerative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Divisive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Polythetic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Monothetic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sharp&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fuzzy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supervised&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unsupervised&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Useful&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not useful&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# A cautionary tale

* Cluster analysis _per se_ is _unsupervised_; we want to find groups in our data.
* We will define _classification_ as a _supervised_ procedure where we know _a priori_ what the groups are.

---

# A cautionary tale

&gt; The availability of computer packages of classification techniques has led to the waste of more valuable scientific time than any other "statistical" innovation (with the possible exception of multiple regression techniques).

# Hierarchical cluster analysis

---

# Agglomerative hierarchical clustering

* Agglomerative methods start with all observations in separate clusters and fuse the two most similar observations.
* Fusion continues, with the two most similar observations and/or clusters being fused at each step.
* Five main stages in this analysis:
    * calculate matrix of _(dis)similarities_ `\(d_{ij}\)` between all pairs of `\(m\)` objects,
    * fuse objects into groups using chosen _clustering strategy_,
    * display the results graphically via a _dendrogram_ or superimposed on to an ordination,
    * check for distortion,
    * validate the results

---

# Clustering strategies

* Different strategies can be used to determine the dissimilarity (_distance_) between a sample and a cluster or two clusters.

* Single link or nearest neighbour;
    * the distance between the closest members of two clusters,
    * finds the minimum spanning tree, the shortest tree connecting all points,
    * can produce _chaining_, producing groups of unequal size.

* Complete link or furthest neighbour;
    * the distance between the farthest members of two clusters,
    * produces compact clusters of roughly equal size,
    * may make compact groups even when none exist

---

# Clustering strategies

* Centroid;
    * the distance between the centroids (the centre of gravity) of two clusters,
    * centroid is the point that is the average of the coordinates (variables) of all objects in the cluster
    * can produce reversals

* Unweighted group average
    * the average of the distances between the samples in one cluster and the samples of another,
    * intermediate between single and complete link methods,
    * maximises the **cophenetic correlation**,
    * may make compact clusters where none exist,

---

# Clustering strategies
* Minimum variance (Ward's method)
    * fuse two groups if and only if neither group will combine with any other group to produce a lower within group **sum of squares**
    * forms compact clusters of equal size; even where none exist,

* Data are mean values of each of six measurements of specimens from 7 canine groups

# _k_-means clustering

# _k_-means clustering

* Hierarchical clustering has a legacy of history: once formed, clusters cannot be changed even if it would be sensible to do so.
* `\(k\)`-means is an iterative procedure that produces a non-hierarchical cluster analysis.
* If algorithm started from a hierarchical cluster analysis, it will be optimised.
* Best suited with _centroid_, _group-average_ or _minimum variance_ linkage methods.
* Computationally difficult; cannot be sure that an optimal solution is found.

---

# _k_-means clustering

* Given `\(n\)` objects in an `\(m\)`-dimensional space, find a partition into `\(k\)` groups (clusters) such that the objects within each cluster are more similar to one another than to objects in the other clusters.
* `\(k\)`-means minimises the within group sums of squares (WSS).
* `\(k\)` is chosen by the user; a scree plot of the WSS for `\(k = 1,\dots,a\)` where `\(a\)` is some small number.
* Even with modest `\(n\)` cannot evaluate all possible partitions to find one with lowest WSS.
* As such, algorithms have been developed that rearrange existing partitions and keep the new one only if it is an improvement.

# _k_-means clustering algorithm

* `\(k\)`-means algorithm proceeds as follows:
    1. Find some initial partition of the individuals into `\(k\)` groups. May be provided by previous hierarchical cluster analysis,
    2. Calculate the change in the clustering criterion (e.g. WSS) by moving each individual from its current cluster to another,
    3. Make the change that leads to the greatest improvement in the value of the clustering criterion,
    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no move of an individual leads to an improvement in the clustering criterion.
* If variables are on different scales, they should be standardised before applying `\(k\)`-means.
* Display results on an ordination; no hierarchy so no dendrogram.

# k-means clustering: Ponds

* Cluster 30 shallow ponds and pools from south east UK on basis of water chemistry.
* Run `\(k\)`-means for `\(k = 1,\dots,10\)` and collect WSS.

# Indicator species analysis

---

# Detection of indicator species

* A basic concept and tradition in ecology and biogeography.
* Species characteristic of e.g. particular habitat, geographical region, vegetation type.
* Adds ecological meaning to groups of sites delineated by cluster analysis.
* _Indicator species_ are species that are indicative of particular groups of sites.
* _Good_ indicator species should be found mostly in a single group _and_ be present be present at most sites in that group.
* This is an important duality: _faithfulness_ and _constancy_.

---

# INDVAL

* _INDVAL_ method of Dufrene and Legendre (1997; _Ecological Monographs_ 67, 345--366) is a well respected approach for identifying indicator species.
* INDVAL can derive indicator species for any clustering of objects.
* Indicator species values based only on within-species abundances and occurrence comparisons. Values not affected by abundances of other species.
* Significance of indicator values for each species is determined via a randomisation procedure.

---

# INDVAL

* _Specificity_ is `\(A_{ij} = \mu_{\mathrm{species}_{ij}} / \mu_{\mathrm{species}_i}\)`.
* _Fidelity_ is `\(B_{ij} = \mu_{\mathrm{sites}_{ij}} / \mu_{\mathrm{sites}_i}\)`.
* `\(A_{ij}\)` is maximum when species `\(i\)` is present only in group `\(j\)`.
* `\(B_{ij}\)` is maximum when species `\(i\)` is present in all sites within group `\(j\)`.
* `\(\mathrm{INDVAL}_{ij} = (A_{ij} \times B_{ij} \times 100)\%\)`.
* Indicator value for species `\(i\)` is the largest value of `\(\mathrm{INDVAL}_{ij}\)` observed over all `\(j\)` groups: `\(\mathrm{INDVAL}_i = \mathrm{max}(\mathrm{INDVAL}_{ij})\)`.
* `\(\mathrm{INDVAL}_i\)` will be 100% when individuals of species `\(i\)` are observed at all sites belonging only to group `\(j\)`.
* A random reallocation of sites among groups is used to test the significance of `\(\mathrm{INDVAL}_i\)`.

# Interpretting clusters

---

# Silhouette widths

* Deciding how many clusters should be retained is problematic
* Little good theory to guide the choice
* Silhouette plots offer a simple graphical means for assessing quality of a clustering
* Silhouette width `\(s_i\)` of object `\(i\)` is
    `$$s_i = \frac{b_i - a_i}{\mathrm{max}(a_i, b_i)}$$`
* `\(a_i\)` is average distance of object `\(i\)` to all other objects in same cluster
* `\(b_i\)` is smallest distance of object `\(i\)` to another cluster
* Hence, maximal value of `\(s_i\)` will be found where the intra-cluster distance `\(a\)` is much smaller that the inter-cluster distance `\(b\)`

# Relating classifications to external sets of variables

* Cluster analysis is not an end in and of itself. It is a means to an end.
* Interpretation of results of cluster analysis can be aided through the use of external data, e.g. environmental data used to aid interpretation of species-derived clusters.
* Basic EDA graphical approaches, such as boxplots, coded scatterplots.
* Discriminants analysis.
* Indicator species analysis.

A measure of the variety of biological life present

Perhaps taking into account the relative abundances

*species diversity* is a quantitative measure of the variety or number of different species

# How shall we define "diversity"?

Diversity indices attempt to quantify

* the probability of encountering different species at random, or,

* the uncertainty or multiplicity of possible community states (i.e., the entropy of community composition), or,

* the variance in species composition, relative to a multivariate centroid

---

# Measuring variety

Imgaine a species pool with `\(R\)` species

In a sample with only `\(R = 1\)` species the sample can take on only `\(R = 1\)` states

The abundance of that one species is 100% and all others are zero

---

# Measuring variety

Now imagine a sample with two species `\(R = 2\)`

The community could take on `\(R(R - 1)\)` different states

The first species could by any of the R species

The second species could be any of the *ther* species

All the other species are zero

---

# Measuring variety

Increasing diversity means increasing the possible states that the community could take,

This increases our uncertainty about community structure

This increasing lack of information about the system is a form of *entropy*

Increasing diversity is increasing entropy

---

# Measuring variety

Three commonly used diversity indices

* Species richness `\(R\)`

* Shannon-Wiener diversity

* Simpson's diversity

---

# Species richness

The count of the number of species in a sample or area

Simple

Most commonly used

--

Deceptively simple; need to have common sampling effort

---

# Shannon-Wiener diversity

`$$H^{\prime} = - \sum_{i=1}^{R} p_i \log_e(p_i)$$`

This is the standard measure of entropy or disorder in a system

Originates from Claude Shannon's work in *information theory*

---

# Simpson's diversity

`$$S_D = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{R} p_i^2$$`

* the probability that two individuals drawn at random from a community will be different species

* the initial slope of the *species-individuals curve*

* the expected *variance* of species composition

---

# Measuring variety

The three indices are directly related

They all estimate *entropy*, the amount of disorder or the multiplicity of possible states of a system

`\(R\)` depends most heavily on the *rare* species

`\(S_D\)` depends most heavily on the *common* species

and `\(H^{\prime}\)` is somewhere in between

---

# Diversity metrics

Three popular ones are

1. Shannon-Wiener (Wrongly Shannon-Weaver)

2. Simpson

3. Inverse Simpson

`\(p_i\)` is proportion of species `\(i\)`

`\(S\)` is number of species (richness)

# Partitioning diversity

Refer to biodiversity at different scales; `\(\alpha\)`, `\(\beta\)`, and `\(\gamma\)`

* Alpha diversity, `\(\alpha\)`, is the diversity of a point location or of a single sample

* Beta diversity, `\(\beta\)`, is the diversity due to multiple localities; `\(\beta\)` diversity is
sometimes thought of as turnover in species composition among sites, or alternatively as the number of species in a region that are not observed in a sample

* Gamma diversity, `\(\gamma\)`, is the diversity of a region, or at least the diversity
of all the species in a set of samples collected over a large area

---

# Partitioning diversity

Diversity across spatial scales can be partitioned in one of two ways

1. *additive*, or,

2. *multiplicative*

partitioning

---

# Additive partitioning

`$$\bar{\alpha} + \beta = \gamma$$`

`\(\bar{\alpha}\)` is the average diversity of a samples, while `\(\gamma\)` is the diversity of the pooled samples

`\(\beta\)` is found by difference

`$$\beta = \gamma - \bar{\alpha}$$`

We can think of `\(\beta\)` as the average number of species not found in a sample, but which we know
to be in the region

---

# Multiplicative partitioning

`$$\bar{\alpha} \beta = \gamma$$`

where `\(\beta\)` is a conversion factor that describes the relative change in species composition among samples

Sometimes this type of `\(\beta\)` diversity is thought of as the number of different community types in a set of samples

---

# Rarefaction

Species richness increases with sample size (effort)

Rarefaction gives the expected number of species rarefied from `\(N\)` to `\(n\)` individuals

`$$\hat{S}_n = \sum_{i=1}^S (1 - q_i) \; \mathsf{where} \; q_i = \frac{\binom{N - x_i}{n}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$`

`\(x_i\)` is count of species `\(i\)` and `\(\binom{N}{n}\)` is a binomial coefficient &amp;mdash; the number of ways to choose `\(n\)` from `\(N\)`

# Rarefaction

With rarefaction we can be accused of throwing away data

Yet we need to do something about the often large differences in variances of species and samples owing to sampling effort

---

# High-throughput data

Revolutions in biology &amp; biotechnology have lead to exponential increases in our capacity to generate data arising from the counting of biological molecules

* DNA sequencing,
* RNA-Seq &amp;mdash; sequence RNA molecules in populations of cells or tissues,
* ChIp-Seq &amp;mdash; sequence DNA molecules that are bound to particular proteins,
* &amp;hellip;

Relative cheaply, today we can generate data sets with thousands of variables on tens to hundreds of samples

---

# High-throughput data

Counts of such molecules present a statistical challenge

* the counts typically have a large *dynamic range*, covering many orders of magnitudes

* over this very large range we observe changes in both variance (spread about the mean) and also in distribution of the data &amp;mdash; **heterogeneity**

* like other count data, observations are integers and distributions are skewed

* the biotech methodology imparts systematic sampling biases into the data that we need to account for in an analysis &amp;mdash; typically called **normalization** in this sub-field

---

# Sequence depth &amp; size factors

The number of reads for each sample is a kind of *effort* variable

All else equal, the more reads we generate the more species (OTUs, ASVs, etc) we would expect to identify

If number of reads differs between samples (libraries) then, all else equal we might assume the counts in different samples are proportional to one another, following some proportionality factor `\(s\)`

A simple estimate for `\(s\)` might be the total reads per sample

But we can do better than this &amp;hellip;

# Variance stabilizing transformations

The square-root transformation is known as the _variance stabilizing transformation_ for the Poisson distribution

Taking the square root of observations that are distributed Poisson leads to *homoscedasticity*

Can construct variance stabilizing transformations for other distributions

High-throughput count data typically show extra-Poisson variation

`DESeq2::vst()` 

---

# Regularized log transform

This transforms counts to a log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like scale via a simple model

`$$\log_2(q_{ij}) = \sum_k x_{jk} \beta_{ik}$$`

where `\(q_{ij}\)` are the transformed data and `\(x_{jk}\)` is a particular design matrix with a dummy variable for the `\(j\)`th sample for (`\(i = {1, 2, \dots m}\)` variables)

Priors on the `\(\beta_{ik}\)` make the model identifiable

The _rlog_ transformation is ~ variance stabilizing, but handles highly varying size factors across samples

`DESeq2::rlog()`

???

Figure 8.12: Per-gene standard deviation (sd, taken across samples) against the rank of the mean, for the shifted logarithm , the variance-stabilizing transformation (vst) and the rlog. Note that for the leftmost  2,500 genes, the counts are all zero, and hence their standard deviation is zero. The mean-sd dependence becomes more interesting for genes with non-zero counts. Note also the high value of the standard deviation for genes that are weakly detected (but not with all zero counts) when the shifted logarithm is used, and compare to the relatively flat shape of the mean-sd relationship for the variance-stabilizing transformation.

---

# Implications

Size factors can be used in GLMs etc to normalize samples via as `offset()` term in the formula

For ordination we can't easily use the size factors

Need to use _vst_ or _rlog_ instead

_rlog_ creates data that can't be used in CCA, so if you use it, RDA or db-RDA are the ordination methods to use

---

# Practicalities



---

# Rarefied counts

Can take a random draw `\(n^{\prime}\)` out of the `\(N\)` individuals in a sample in proportion to species abundances

This yields rarefied counts which some people then go on to analyse

Be careful though as this is a random process &amp;mdash; what if you took a different random sample?

---

# Rarefied counts

`avgdist()` in *vegan* tries to get around this by

1. taking a random draw to get rarefied counts
2. computing dissimilarity between smaples on basis of rarefied count

Repeat that many times and then as your dissimilarity `\(d_{ij}\)`, take the average of the many `\(d_{ij}^*\)` values you generated above

See also the help page for other suggestions `?avgdist`
