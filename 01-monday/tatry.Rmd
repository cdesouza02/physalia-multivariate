# Tatry Mountain Data

Vegetation records (releves) from an altitudinal transect in Nizke Tatry Mountains, Slovakia. Releve 1 was recorded at an altitude of 1200m above sea level, while releve 14 at 1830m above sea level. Releves were recorded using a Bruan-Blanquet scale (r, +, 1-5), which was recoded to 1-7 and is on an ordinal scale.

```{r, results = "hide"}
library("readxl") # might need install.packages("readxl")
library("vegan")

tatry <- read_excel("data/tatry.xlsx")
head(tatry)

# or via csv
library("readr")
tatry_url <- "https://bit.ly/tatry-spp"
tatry <- read_csv(tatry_url)
```
